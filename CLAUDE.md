# Claude Engineering Principles

## Senior Engineer Mindset
Always code like a senior engineer with these core principles:

## Code as Liability
- Write the minimum amount of code necessary to solve the problem
- Every line of code is a potential source of bugs and maintenance burden
- Prefer simple, clear solutions over complex ones

## Testing First
- Always ensure code is well tested
- Write tests that validate the core functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Incremental Development
- Make small, incremental changes
- Each change should be focused and purposeful
- Avoid large, sweeping modifications

## Hypothesis-Driven Development
- Identify the hypotheses that need to be validated for each change
- Clearly understand what assumptions are being made
- Validate assumptions through testing and observation

## Adversarial Thinking
- Think adversarially about potential failure modes
- Never be overconfident in changes
- Consider what could go wrong and prepare for it

## Incremental Testing and Commits
- Test incrementally as changes are made
- Make small, focused commits along the way
- Each commit should represent a logical unit of progress
- Validate that each incremental change works before proceeding
