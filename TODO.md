# Remaining Tasks for Maze Generation Implementation

## High Priority (Next Steps)

### 1. Implement Maze Validation Functions
- [ ] Create `MazeValidator` class with connectivity and cycle detection
- [ ] Implement `isConnected()` function using BFS/DFS traversal
- [ ] Implement `hasNoCycles()` function (edge count = vertex count - 1)
- [ ] Add tests for validation functions

### 2. Test DFS Algorithm Mathematical Invariants
- [ ] Verify generated mazes are perfect (connected + acyclic)
- [ ] Test that all cells are reachable from any starting point
- [ ] Verify spanning tree property (V-1 edges for V vertices)
- [ ] Add property-based tests with fast-check for edge cases

### 3. Implement SVG Rendering
- [ ] Create `SVGRenderer` class for maze visualization
- [ ] Handle wall drawing with proper line segments
- [ ] Render entry/exit points differently (e.g., green/red)
- [ ] Support configurable cell size and colors
- [ ] Add tests for SVG output format

## Medium Priority

### 4. Create HTML Page and Browser Integration
- [ ] Build simple HTML page to display rendered maze
- [ ] Add controls for maze dimensions and seed
- [ ] Generate and display maze on button click
- [ ] Open in browser for visual verification

### 5. Add ASCII Rendering (Alternative Visualization)
- [ ] Implement text-based maze rendering for console output
- [ ] Handle border walls and entry/exit points in ASCII
- [ ] Add tests comparing ASCII output to expected patterns

### 6. Performance Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Benchmark maze generation for various grid sizes
- [ ] Test memory usage for large mazes
- [ ] Verify O(V) time complexity for DFS algorithm
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

## Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

### 7. Add Prim's Algorithm Implementation
- [ ] Implement randomized Prim's algorithm
- [ ] Add priority queue data structure
- [ ] Compare maze characteristics between DFS and Prim's
- [ ] Add visual comparison in HTML interface

### 8. Hexagonal Grid Support
- [ ] Implement hexagonal coordinate system (cube coordinates)
- [ ] Create `HexagonalGrid` class with 6-neighbor support
- [ ] Adapt maze generation algorithms for hexagonal topology
- [ ] Add hexagonal SVG rendering

### 9. Additional Features
- [ ] Maze solving algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS)
- [ ] Path highlighting in rendered output
- [ ] Maze difficulty analysis (dead-end counting, path length)
- [ ] Export mazes to various formats (PNG, PDF, JSON)

## Testing Strategy Reminders

### Property-Based Testing Setup
- [ ] Install and configure `fast-check` for property testing
- [ ] Create generators for valid grid dimensions
- [ ] Test maze properties hold for randomly generated inputs
- [ ] Add shrinking for minimal failing examples

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete pipeline: grid → algorithm → validation → rendering
- [ ] Verify border walls are never removed by maze generation
- [ ] Test entry/exit points work correctly with maze solving
- [ ] Cross-test different coordinate systems produce same logical maze

## Implementation Notes

### Current Architecture Status
✅ **Completed:**
- Rectangular grid with coordinate system
- Border wall management and entry/exit points  
- DFS maze generation algorithm
- Comprehensive test suite for grid operations
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation

### Key Design Decisions Made
- 2D array-based grid representation (simple and efficient)
- Border walls are protected and managed separately from internal walls
- Entry/exit points use explicit API rather than direct wall removal
- DFS algorithm chosen for initial implementation (O(V) complexity)
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

### Next Session Plan
1. Start with maze validation functions (critical for correctness)
2. Add SVG rendering for visual feedback
3. Create simple HTML page for browser testing
4. Test mathematical invariants with property-based testing
5. Consider adding Prim's algorithm for algorithm comparison
