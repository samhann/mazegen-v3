# Hexagonal Grid Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY**

### Core Maze Logic
- **HexagonalGrid class** implements Grid interface (src/hexagonal-grid.ts)
- **Hexagonal topology** with proper 6-neighbor relationships
- **Maze generation** works unchanged using existing spanning tree algorithm
- **Maze solving** works unchanged using existing BFS algorithm
- **All validation tests pass** - spanning tree properties, connectivity, etc.

### Architecture Success
- **Grid interface abstraction proven** - new grid types can be added without touching core algorithms
- **Same generation/solving code** works for both rectangular and hexagonal grids
- **Clean separation of concerns** - only Grid implementation needed to change

### Test Results
- 54/54 tests passing including new hexagonal grid tests
- Maze generation produces correct spanning trees (6 passages for 7 cells in radius-1 hex)
- Solution finding works correctly from entrance to exit
- Mathematical properties verified

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **VISUALIZATION ISSUES**

### UniversalSVGRenderer Problems
Located in `src/universal-svg-renderer.ts`:

1. **Missing perimeter walls** 
   - Boundary walls around outer edge not drawn
   - Only internal walls between cells are rendered

2. **Wall intersection gaps**
   - Walls don't connect properly at vertices
   - Small gaps visible between wall segments

3. **Wall positioning**
   - Current logic draws perpendicular lines at midpoints between cells
   - This creates correct topology but doesn't form proper enclosed boundaries

### What Works in Visualization
- ‚úÖ Hexagonal lattice layout visible and correct
- ‚úÖ Solution path drawn correctly through both grid types
- ‚úÖ Cell positions and spacing appropriate
- ‚úÖ Entrance/exit marking works
- ‚úÖ Internal wall placement shows maze structure

## üîß **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### Files Added/Modified
- `src/hexagonal-grid.ts` - New hexagonal grid implementation
- `src/universal-svg-renderer.ts` - Topology-agnostic renderer (partial)
- `tests/hexagonal-grid.test.ts` - Comprehensive hexagonal grid tests
- Updated CLAUDE.md with engineering humility lessons

### Key Design Decisions
- **String IDs** for cells (e.g., "q,r" for hexagonal axial coordinates)
- **Axial coordinate system** internally, converted to cartesian only for rendering
- **Same passage-based representation** for both grid types
- **Grid.neighbors()** abstraction handles topology differences

### Current Renderer Logic
```typescript
// Draws walls between adjacent cells that lack passages
for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
  if (!passageSet.has(`${cell}|${neighbor}`)) {
    // Draw perpendicular line at midpoint - THIS CAUSES GAPS
  }
}
```

## üìã **NEXT STEPS** (for future investigation)

1. **Fix boundary wall rendering**
   - Renderer needs to draw perimeter walls around grid boundary
   - Should detect boundary cells and draw outward-facing walls

2. **Fix wall intersection gaps**
   - Walls should connect at proper vertices instead of floating segments
   - May need to calculate actual cell edge positions rather than midpoints

3. **Maintain universality**
   - Solution must work for any grid topology (rectangular, hexagonal, future types)
   - Avoid hardcoding grid-specific rendering logic

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA MET**

The core goal was achieved: **proving the architecture can handle different grid types elegantly**. 

- ‚úÖ Hexagonal grids work with zero changes to core algorithms
- ‚úÖ Architecture is truly extensible  
- ‚úÖ Maze generation and solving are topology-agnostic
- ‚úÖ Implementation is minimal (80 lines for hexagonal grid)

The visualization issues are isolated to the rendering layer and don't affect the mathematical correctness of the maze functionality.
